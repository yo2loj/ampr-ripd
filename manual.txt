 Usage: ampr-ripd [-?|-h] [-d] [-v] [-s] [-r] [-i <interface>] [-a <ip|hostname|subnet>[,<ip|hostname|subnet>...]] [-p <password>] [-f <interface>] [-e <ip>] [-x <system command>]

 Options:
          -?, -h                Usage info
          -d                    Debug mode: no daemonization, verbose output
          -v                    More verbose debug output
                                Using this option without debug leaves the console attached
          -s                    Save routes to /var/lib/ampr-ripd/encap.txt (encap format),
                                if this file exists, it will be loaded on startup regardless
                                of this option
          -r                    Use raw socket instead of multicast
          -i <interface>        Tunnel interface to use, defaults to tunl0
          -t <table>            Routing table to use, defaults to 'main'
          -a  <ip>[,<ip>...]    Comma separated list of IPs, hostnames or ampr subnets to be ignored.
                                Subnets can be in full network/mask (e.g. 44.182.20.0/24) or encap (e.g. 44.182.20/24) format,
                                but MUST match an entry in the RIP broadcast
                                If a hostname is used, its IP will be re-resolved 30 sec after every RIP broadcast.
                                The List contains local interface IPs by default
          -m <metric>           Metric to be used when setting routes.
                                This is a numerical value from 0 to 255. Defaults to 0.
          -w <window>           Sets the TCP window size to a given value (defaults to 840).
                                This is needed since IP over AX.25 connections have small TCP window size.
                                A value of 0 diables setting the window size (not recommended, default value should be ok)
          -p <password>         RIPv2 password, defaults to none
          -f <interface>        Interface for RIP forwarding, defaults to none/disabled
          -e <ip>               Forward destination IP, defaults to 224.0.0.9 if enabled
          -x <system command>   Execute this system command after route set/change. If the command includes white spaces, use quotes.

 Observation: All routes are created with protocol 44 for easy management


 Signal handling:

   - On signal SIG_HUP, ampr-ripd will delete all set routes, but will remain active,
     so routes will be set again on next received RIPv2 set, and the saved encap file updated.
   - On exit (SIG_TERM), ampr-ripd will delete all set routes and exit.

 Debug:

   - As set up in the makefile, wiyh the default debug level, using the -d option,
     the daemon will stay in the forground and allow you to find the RIPv2 password
     (see the find_pass.sh shell script).
   - To have full debug output, it has to be compiled with -D HAVE_DEBUG  or by
     uncommenting the right DOPT line.

 *    1.10    14.Feb.2014      Small fixes on option and signal processing (Tnx. Demetre, SV1UY))

 *    1.12    16.Nov.2014      Added the execution of a system command after route setting/change. This is done
 *                             on startup with encap file present and 30 seconds after RIP update if encap changes.
 *                             (Tnx. Rob, PE1CHL for the idea)

 INSTALLATION
 ------------
 -Compile with: gcc -O2 -o ampr-ripd ampr-ripd.c or use the make script
 -Copy the file ampr-ripd to a proper location, e.g. /usr/sbin
 -Create the folder /var/lib/ampr-ripd
 -Launch with proper parameters as described above
Or:
 -Just do a 'make install' in the source folder,


 KNOWN ISSUES
 ------------
 - when using other table than 'main', interogating the routes via netlink does not work properly.
   This means that on any update, the route is deleted and then recreated, even if it is already set correctly.
   This should be no problem since this happen only at startup on encap loading and on route change.
